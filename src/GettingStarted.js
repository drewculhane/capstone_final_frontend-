                  if you need to grab a snack while playing, or waiting for MOBs to respawn. If this cool RP wasn't enough, as a Druid, this RP makes your "prowl" ability in Cat Form
                  even more effective at hiding you from hostile MOBs.

                      right now an extra 1% dodge doesn't sound meaningful, on ocassion, it makes the difference between life or death. Many "Best in Slot" gear items for Feral druids add an extra few % chances to dodge or critical-hit.

          <h2>  It's pretty convenient to pick up Herbalism and/or Skinning when you come to Dolanaar in Teldrassil, alongside a myriad of other secondary and primary skills. You can only have two primary skills. 
              The Herbalism trainer is in town, but the skinning trainer is a little further up the road towards Darnassus. If you want to buy a skinning knife ahead of time, 
              talk to Narret Shadowgrove in Dolanaar. For a full list of Dolanaar trainers and NPCs/POIs, see the link below. We recommend getting started on leveling your primary skills ASAP while you are progressing from 
              levels 1-10. *** Please Note, Teldrassil is one of the best places to level apprentice Herbalism. It's a tree and it is filled with herbs. *** If you are planning on being a FERAL DPS or a TANK, we recommend 
              getting Leatherworking as one of your two primary skills. That way you can make "Devilsaur Gauntlets", and "Devilsaur Leggings" which are Best in Slot later in the game.
